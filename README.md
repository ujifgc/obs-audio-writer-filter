# An audio writer filter for OBS

## Use cases

- You stream something with Noise gate and Compressor filters but you want to keep the original audio for postproduction with better quality tools

## Usage

1. Download a zip from https://github.com/ujifgc/obs-audio-writer-filter/releases
2. Unpack it to your OBS folder (may require privileges)
3. Run OBS
4. Add an "Audio Writer" filter to an audio source (MIC for example)
5. Select a folder with enough space
6. Select WAV or AAC encoder (AAC requires CoreAudio to be installed)
7. Run a stream or recording, ensure that the Volume Meter is alive
8. Stop the stream or recording
9. You will have files named like "obs-audio-writer [MIC] 2019-09-29 12-05-48.aac" in the specified folder

## AAC encoder

The filter uses CoreAudio encoder to write AAC format. To install it you may have to follow instructions here:

## Troubleshooting

#### The file is too small or corrupted

Please ensure that you use appropriate build for your OBS version.  
Major OBS releases change ABI so this plugin could fail to capture audio stream.  
If there's no build for your OBS version please report it here: https://github.com/ujifgc/obs-audio-writer-filter/issues
